# Hi, i'm sud0nt

## I'm interested in sysadmin/pentesting stuff and things.

I've got a 3 Node Proxmox Cluster running everything from Ansible, Kali, LAMP Server, 3 node K8s Cluster. It's got it all. But I'm going to be putting most of the automation stuff I do with it up here on Github in a repository, so feel free to browse and grab and use whatever you'd like.

If you'd like to send old hard drives, or any spare computer parts associated with homelabbing too me, please feel free. PO BOX:
